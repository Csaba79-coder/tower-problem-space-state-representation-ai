# Space state representation - Artificial Intelligence - solving the tower problem

## Description

> **The Tower of Problem, as addressed in the Milton Friedman University's course,**
> is successfully solved through the application of space state representation. This
> involves a strategic approach to representing and navigating the possible states of
> the Tower Problem configuration. The course delves into the intricacies of this
> problem-solving technique, emphasizing the importance of space state representation
> in efficiently reaching solutions for the problem. The Tower Problem is a classic
> example of a problem that can be solved through space state representation.

# Task

<span style="white-space: pre-line; color: #1E90FF;">
    From the top of a tower, three people need to be brought down to the base. 
    You have a snail with a long rope, each end of which has a basket, and there's also a large stone. 
    The weights of the individuals are 78, 42, and 36 kilograms, and the stone weighs 30 kg. 
    Each basket can accommodate at most two people or one person and one stone. If there is a person in any basket, 
    for safety reasons, there can be at most a 6 kg difference in weight between the two baskets. Initially, 
    the basket at the lower end of the lowered rope contains the stone.
