Implementation of a state representation for a problem involving moving people and a stone between baskets using a snail with a long rope. The goal is to move three people from the top of a tower to the base while adhering to certain weight constraints.

Here are some positive aspects of your implementation:

State Representation: You have defined the state of the problem with the relevant variables, such as weights of people and the stone, basket positions, and the current state of each person (up or down).

Operators: You have outlined the possible operations (operators) that can be performed on the state. These operations involve moving the stone and people between baskets, considering the weight constraints.

Goal State: You have defined the goal state, which indicates when the three people are safely brought down to the base.

Preconditions and Safety Checks: You've implemented preconditions and safety checks to ensure that operations are valid and do not violate the specified constraints.

However, there are areas where you could improve or enhance your implementation:

Code Duplication: There is some code duplication in the op method where you handle the movement of each person and the stone. Consider refactoring this part to reduce redundancy.

Magic Numbers: There are some magic numbers in your code (e.g., 6 in the checkBasketWeightDifference method). Consider defining constants for these numbers to improve code readability and maintainability.

Comments: While you have added comments in the code, some parts could benefit from more descriptive comments, especially regarding the purpose and logic behind certain calculations or operations.

Operator Count: The getOperatorCount method returns a hardcoded value of 18. You may want to dynamically calculate the number of possible operators based on your problem definition to avoid hardcoding.

Overall, your implementation provides a good foundation for solving the described problem. As you continue developing and testing your solution, you can iteratively refine and improve it based on feedback and additional considerations.
