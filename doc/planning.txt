1. extend the abstract state

2. override the methods in the child class that extends the abstract class

    2.1 Define the starting state -> constructor

    2.2 Define the goal state -> override the isGoal method

    2.3 Count the number of operations -> override the getOperatorCount() method

    2.4 Define the operators -> override the isSuperOperator(int i) method (using switch case with the operator number &
       lambda expressions)


    Extra / not necessary to override:

    2.5. Clone method needs to be overridden in the child class if we use Array or ArrayList

    2.6. Equals method needs to be overridden in the child class if I can get back to the same state of the object
         by using the equals method -> this means a circle exists in the state space (this override is needed to avoid
            infinite loops)
